      <description>Hello! My name is Eric Sherman. Background My professional and academic background is highly interdisciplinary. I studied Political Science(focusing in organizational theory, political economy, and urban politics) and Geography and Environmental Studies (Focusing in Urban Planning, Sustainable Development and GIS).
As a first generation college student from a working-class family, much of my interests revolve around a desire to understand the struggles faced by disadvantaged communities or individuals, as well an overall curiosity for what makes functional communities &amp;lsquo;tick&amp;rsquo;, and to bring these stories to a wider audience.</description>
